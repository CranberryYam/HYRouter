# Introduction
HYRouter is the router framework that I built while I was doing one of my app with module development. It helps you decouple ViewControllers, run all your ViewControllers in a debug UITableViewController and flexibly set up the main UITabbarController.

If you use traditinal navigation methods offered by Apple, you can't decouple two modules. Each time when you navigate to the B_ViewController, you have to init an object of the B_ViewController. It means that you have to know the existence the B_ViewController Class. When the B_ViewController is from a different module, decoupling modules becomes very tough.

## Feathers
- [x] Navigate through the ViewController Identifier Â 
- [x] Pass data between ViewControllers easily
- [x] Support ViewController with storyboard or without storyboard
- [x] Configure the main UITabBarController with a dictionary
- [x] Setup entries for all ViewController in the dubug mode
